/*
    Histamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter produced by neurons of the hypothalamus,
    cells of the stomach mucosa, mast cells, and basophils in the blood. In the central nervous system,
    it is important for wakefulness, blood pressure, pain, and sexual behavior. In the stomach,
    it increases the acidity.

    It is involved primarily in the inflammatory response, as well as a range of other functions such as
    vasodilation and regulation of the immune response to foreign bodies. For example, when allergens are
    introduced into the bloodstream, histamine assists in the fight against these microorganisms causing
    itching of the skin or irritations of the throat, nose, and or lungs.
