 * Glutamate (Glu) is the most powerful excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system which
 * ensures homeostasis with the effects of GABA. It is secreted by neurons of the many of the sensory
 * pathways entering the central nervous system, as well as the cerebral cortex.
 *
 * Glutamate is the most common neurotransmitter in the central nervous system;
 * it takes part in the regulation of general excitability of the central nervous system,
 * learning processes, and memory. Thus, inappropriate glutamate neurotransmission contributes to
 * developing epilepsy and cognitive and affective disorders.
