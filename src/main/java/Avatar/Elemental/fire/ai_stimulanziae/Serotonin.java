Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that has been found to be
intimately involved in emotion and mood. It is secreted by the neurons of the brainstem and by neurons that
innervate the gastrointestinal tract (enteric nervous system). In addition, serotonin is found in platelets
(thrombocytes) which release it during coagulation (hemostasis).
