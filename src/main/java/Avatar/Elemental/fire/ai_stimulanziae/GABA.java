/**
 * gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most powerful inhibitory neurotransmitter
 * produced by the neurons of the spinal cord, cerebellum, basal ganglia,
 * and many areas of the cerebral cortex. It is derived from glutamate.
 *
 * Functions of GABA are closely related to mood and emotions.
 * It is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts as a brake to excitatory neurotransmitters;
 * thus when it is abnormally low this can lead to anxiety. It is widely distributed in the brain and
 * plays a principal role in reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.
